Eternal is a mod that loads your game with much content
possible, including a new difficulty!
From what we expect, this mod is not fully finished yet so
there is no harm in cheating in anything from the mod via HERO's, Cheat Sheet and/or DragonLens...

---Hell Mode---
Hell Mode is a new difficulty that can be toggled in Expert/Master Mode, you can get
special drops from bosses! (not all hell-mode drops and content are fully fleshed out yet...)

---Sinstorm Mode (WIP)---
Sinstorm Mode is a new difficulty that is harder than Hell Mode, can be toggled only when
Hell Mode is Active. (no sinstorn exclusive drops have been added yet...)

---The Rift---
The Rift is a dangerous post-Cosmic Apparition event that can be toggled with the Star Spiral. Upon
using it, you open The Rift and deadly enemies start spawning as well as a new miniboss, by defeating
the Ark of Imperious and the Cosmic Apparition in The Rift, enemies will start dropping new materials
to make powerful armor and weapons.

---NOTICE---
This is a public beta build of Eternal, bugs and other sketchy things may arise!

--CONTENT BREAKDOWN--
5/32 Bosses (some bosses are in the game, however they may not be finished, but could be in the future)
230+ Items, materials, tools, weapons and armor
2 new biomes (WIP)
1 new structure (WIP)
