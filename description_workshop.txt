Eternal is a mod that loads your game with much content
possible, including a new difficulty!
From what we expect, this mod is not fully finished yet so
there is no harm in cheating in anything from the mod via HERO's and/or Cheat Sheet...

---Hell Mode---
Hell Mode is a new difficulty that can be toggled in Expert/Master Mode, you can get
special drops from bosses! (not all hell-mode drops and content are fully fleshed out yet...)

---Sinstorm Mode (WIP)---
Sinstorm Mode is a new difficulty that is harder than Hell Mode, can be toggled only when
Hell Mode is Active. (no sinstorn exclusive drops have been added yet...)

---NOTICE---
This is a public alpha build of the 1.4 port of Eternal, bugs and other sketchy things may arise!

--CONTENT BREAKDOWN--
5/32 Bosses (some bosses are in the game, however they may not be finished, but could be in the future)
230+ Items, materials, tools, weapons and armor
2 new biomes (WIP)
1 new structure (WIP)
22+ Enemies
3 Town NPCs (one of them is a WIP)
