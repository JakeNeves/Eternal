-----------------------

Eternal is a mod which aims to add some random stuff into your Terraria
experience, with a plan of 32 total bosses and some minibosses, and don't
forget, hundreds upon hundreds of items (maybe thousands). There is also
a brand new difficulty to spice up a bit of your gameplay and have some reward
from each boss (not all rewards are available yet...), and even some post-Moon Lord
content to make things a bit more fun with a chance of sudden randomness from out of
complete nowhere!
