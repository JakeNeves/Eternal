-----------------------

Eternal is a mod which aims to add some random stuff into your Terraria
experience, with a plan of 32 total bosses and some minibosses, and don't
forget, hundreds upon hundreds of items (maybe thousands). There is also
a brand new difficulty to spice up a bit of your gameplay and have some reward
from each boss (not all rewards are available yet...), and even some post-Moon Lord
content to make things a bit more fun with a chance of sudden randomness from out of
complete nowhere!

## tModLoader 1.4 Port

-----------------------

The Eternal mod is currently being ported to 1.4, the 1.3 version is no longer receiving support.
Everything will be ported, but does this really mean everything? technically no, but there is a who bunch
of new content coming to the 1.4 port fortunatley, most of the content will be returning and some of it
will be either removed or replaced.

### The Content port to 1.4

Most of the content will be ported over to 1.4, however some of it will look and/or work completely different.
Some of the content will also be renamed to something else (e.g., Imperious Cohort -> Arkrystal Blade, Shooting Starbow -> Starfall, etc.).
