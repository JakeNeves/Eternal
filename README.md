new items, the Ancient Pendant is
an accessory that gives an increase 
to Melee Damage and the Death Charm,
(Formally known as the Blood Locket)
is an item that is used to toggle
the new difficulty, "Hell Mode"!

Hell Mode is a challenge difficulty
that makes bosses a tiny bit
EXTREME, vanilla bosses will have
an increase of Health, Damage and
sometimes Defense, while the Eternal
Mod Bosses get special and unique
abilities, all bosses in Hell Mode
all have a special drop excluseive
