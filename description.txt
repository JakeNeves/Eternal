[c/1EC9E3:Eternal] - By [c/008CFF:Jake][c/0204CFF:TEM]!

beta 1.0.1

---LOOKING FOR SPRITE ARTISTS AND PROGRAMMERS---

Applications can be found here under "#applications" https://discord.gg/GJYKRBt

Eternal is a mod that loads your game with much content
possible, including a new difficulty (NYI - Coming soon, I think...)!
From what we expect, if you're going to use this mod, I recommend you either install HERO's or
Cheat Sheet as this mod is not finished yet...
