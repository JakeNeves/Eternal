Eternal is a mod that loads your game with much content
possible, including a new difficulty (WIP)!
From what we expect, this mod is not fully finished yet so there is no harm in cheating in anything from the mod via HERO's and/or Cheat Sheet...

It currently adds
Two pre-hardmode bosses
Two out of the ten hardmode bosses
and one out of the twenty post-moon lord bosses (there is actually another boss, part of the twenty post-moon lord bosses but it's a WIP as of right now, however you can summon it through HERO's or Cheat Sheet)
